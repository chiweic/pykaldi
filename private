set up on the X11 NOT to use Nvidia so we get all the memory:

add the following to /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Section "Device"
    Identifier      "intel"
    Driver          "intel"
    BusId           "PCI:0:2:0"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier      "intel"
    Device          "intel"
EndSection
